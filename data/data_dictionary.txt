Data Dictionary for the "all.csv" file, which is a consolidation
of many different datasets that have been normalized,
and contains the data that I will use for this project.

"Norm" in any column means the normalized version
of the target column. The norm is computated as
norm(x) = (x_i - min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

Firearm Data
    Contains homicide and suicide deaths by firearm for the year 2014.
For firearm columns, rate is defined at number of deaths per 100,000.
Norm is based on the rate column. NOTE: 0 deaths does not mean 0 deaths
actually occured, but that there were few enough that they could not
be report without potentially violating individual confidentiality.
